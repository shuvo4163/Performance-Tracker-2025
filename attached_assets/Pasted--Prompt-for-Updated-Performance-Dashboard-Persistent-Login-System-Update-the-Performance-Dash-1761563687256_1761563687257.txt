🧠 Prompt (for Updated Performance Dashboard & Persistent Login System)
Update the Performance Dashboard section of the web app with the following features and structure:
📊 Dashboard Table Columns
Add or reorder columns exactly as follows:
SL | Date | Link | Title | Views | Reach | Engagement | Voice Artist | Script Writer | Video Editor | Topic Selector | Mojo Reporter | Jela Reporter | Photo Card | SEO | Website News | Content Status | Actions
🗓️ Date Column
•	Include a Date input field for each content entry.
•	Default value = current date (auto-filled when new entry added).
•	Allow manual change via date picker.
•	The date helps in monthly filtering and report generation.
💾 Data Persistence
•	All entered data (Performance, Employee Data, Jela Reporter Data) must be saved automatically in LocalStorage or IndexedDB.
•	Data should not be deleted or reset automatically — even after page reload, browser close, or device restart.
•	Only Admin can manually delete or reset data from the “Admin Settings” panel.
•	If “Moderator” logs in, the data remains read/write but non-deletable.
🔐 Persistent Login System
•	Once an Admin or Moderator logs in, the session stays active until they manually log out.
•	Even if the page reloads or the browser closes, the user remains logged in (using LocalStorage or SessionStorage).
•	Show “Logout” button in the top-right corner.
•	After clicking Logout → clear session and return to login page.
🧱 Actions Column
•	Each row should have an “Actions” menu with:
o	✏️ Edit
o	🗑️ Delete (Admin only)
o	📄 View Details
•	Show confirmation popup before deleting any row.
🎨 Design
•	Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, dashboard-style look.
•	Add a subtle highlight for the “Date” and “Content Status” columns.
•	Table must be responsive for desktop and mobile.
•	Keep consistent design with Employee Data and Jela Reporter Data sections.
⚙️ Permissions Recap
•	Admin: Full access (Add/Edit/Delete, Reset Data, Logout).
•	Moderator: Can Add/Edit, Logout, but cannot delete or reset.
✅ Summary
•	Data from all sections remains permanently saved locally.
•	Users stay logged in until they log out manually.
