🧠 Prompt for "Work Flow" & "Video Upload Time" Modules (with Notes + Admin Control)

Add two new modules after the Performance Dashboard:
1️⃣ Work Flow
2️⃣ Video Upload Time
Both modules must be accessible from the left menu and controllable (ON/OFF) from the Admin Settings.

🧩 1️⃣ Work Flow

Goal: Visual dashboard for assigning job categories and tracking tasks among team members.

Features:

Admin can create multiple work categories (e.g. Desk Reporter, Video Editor, Mojo Reporter, etc.).

Each category can have multiple job blocks like “JOB 1”, “JOB 2”, etc.

When a category is clicked, its connected jobs visually appear (like a node diagram — see reference image).

Use connecting lines or flow arrows to show task flow between jobs.

All data should be stored locally (no server) and remain even after reload.

Admin Controls:

Admin can Add/Edit/Delete categories and jobs.

Only Admin can edit the Work Flow section.

Moderators and users can view only.

Notes Section:

Below the Work Flow, add a NOTE section.

Any user (Admin or Moderator) can add/edit/delete notes — visible to all.

Notes should be styled like boxes with “To: [Person Name]” and message area.

Notes auto-save locally.

Design:

Red rounded buttons for each category and job (like image).

Smooth animations when a category is opened.

Notes area styled as gray rounded boxes with editable content.

🕒 2️⃣ Video Upload Time

Goal: Manage and view daily upload schedule for all video categories.

Table Columns:

Video Category | Channel (YT) | Page (FB) | Script/Footage Deliver Time | Upload Time


Features:

Admin can Add/Edit/Delete rows.

Moderators can only view.

Auto-save data locally.

Option to print/export to PDF with title:

Daily Our Bangladesh
Video Upload Time Schedule


The design should look like the example table provided.

⚙️ Admin Settings Controls

In the Admin Settings page, add:

Toggle switches:

✅ Show/Hide “Work Flow”

✅ Show/Hide “Video Upload Time”

Only Admin can toggle these options.

When OFF — the feature is hidden from all menus.
