Build an interactive Work Flow module that works exactly like the given description and example image.

⚙️ Main Structure

The Work Flow page should first allow the Admin to:

➕ Add new Post Type (example: Desk Reporter, Mojo Reporter, etc.)

➕ Add multiple Jobs under each Post Type.

Each Post Type and its Jobs are stored locally (LocalStorage/IndexedDB).

Jobs are visually linked to their Post Type.

🎬 User Interaction

Display all Post Types (buttons) on the Work Flow dashboard.

When a user clicks on any Post Type:

All other Post Types become hidden or fade out.

The clicked Post Type stays centered on screen.

Its related Jobs appear around it with motion animation (smooth transition or radial layout).

A small ❌ (close) button appears beside the active Post Type.

When the ❌ button is clicked:

The Jobs disappear with animation.

All hidden Post Types reappear.

The layout returns to the original state.

💾 Data Management

All Post Types and their Jobs must be saved in LocalStorage (persistent after reload).

Admin can:

Edit or delete a Post Type.

Add/edit/delete jobs for each post.

Moderator and general users can only view.

🧭 Design & Animation

Use Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (or simple CSS transitions) for animation.

Buttons:

Post buttons = bright red (#FF0000), rounded, bold white text.

Job buttons = slightly smaller red buttons connected with yellow lines.

Motion animation:

Jobs spread out radially or in a circular layout around the clicked Post Type.

Smooth fade/slide transitions when showing or hiding jobs.

Add a title “Work Flow” at the top (centered).

Keep the layout responsive for desktop and tablet view.

🔒 Access Control

Only Admin can:

Add / Edit / Delete Post Types and Jobs.

Moderator and other users:

Can only view and interact (click to open/close Post Jobs).

Data persists after reload or logout.

📝 Optional Note Section (below the flow)

A simple editable “Note” area where all users can add small messages.

Notes auto-save locally and are visible to everyone.
