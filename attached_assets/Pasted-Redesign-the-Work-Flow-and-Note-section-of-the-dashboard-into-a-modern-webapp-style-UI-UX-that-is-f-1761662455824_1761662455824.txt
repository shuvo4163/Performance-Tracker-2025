Redesign the Work Flow and Note section of the dashboard into a modern, webapp-style UI/UX that is fully responsive and visually appealing.

üéØ Main Goals

Fix issue where added jobs are not visible ‚Äî ensure jobs appear properly under each Post Type.

Completely improve the UI/UX of both the Work Flow and Note sections.

Design must look like a real modern web application dashboard, not a basic HTML layout.

Must be 100% responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

üí° Work Flow Section

Each Post Type should appear as a card or button in a clean grid layout.

When clicked:

All other posts fade out or blur.

The clicked post moves to center with smooth animation.

Its Jobs appear below or around it (visible, animated, properly aligned).

A close (‚ùå) button restores the full view.

Each Post and Job card should have:

Rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover animation.

Consistent color theme (modern red + white or red + dark gray).

Animated transitions using Framer Motion or CSS.

Add/Edit/Delete buttons for Admin should be small, stylish icons (e.g. Lucide or Heroicons).

üóíÔ∏è Note Section

Create a simple yet elegant Note board below the workflow.

Each note should appear as a card with:

User name, date, and message.

Option to add/edit/delete notes (for admin).

Use smooth animations when adding/removing notes.

Use Tailwind‚Äôs modern typography + soft background gradients.

üé® Design Language

Use Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.

Use a clean dashboard layout with a sidebar or top bar (optional).

Use consistent spacing (p-4, gap-4) and grid/flex layouts.

Use Google Fonts (e.g. Inter, Poppins) for a modern feel.

Add light shadows, border radius (rounded-2xl), and hover scale effects.
