# DOB Performance Tracker

## Overview

The DOB Performance Tracker is an internal productivity application designed for tracking team member performance across multiple content roles (voice artists, script writers, video editors, topic selectors, reporters, SEO specialists). It enables data entry for performance metrics (views, reach, engagement), automatic YouTube video information fetching, monthly ranking calculations, voice artist billing management, daily attendance tracking, and administrative controls for system configuration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework Stack**
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast HMR and optimized builds
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing

**UI Component System**
- **shadcn/ui** built on Radix UI with Tailwind CSS
- Design inspired by Material Design + Carbon Design principles for data-heavy applications
- Typography: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (numerical data)
- Custom design tokens in `tailwind.config.ts`

**State Management**
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management and caching
- **React Context API** for authentication state (`AuthContext`)
- **localStorage** for client-side data persistence (performance entries, admin settings)
- **sessionStorage** for authentication session management

**Key Design Patterns**
- Editable table interface with inline editing
- Automatic YouTube video metadata fetching
- Real-time ranking calculations
- Export to Excel functionality
- Persistent login system
- Role-Based Access Control (Admin and Moderator roles)
- Advanced filtering and search panel for performance data
- Employee Data and Jela Reporter Data management with inline editing and time format support

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **tsx** for development, **esbuild** for production
- RESTful endpoint for YouTube video info (`POST /api/youtube/video-info`)

### Data Storage Solutions

**Current Implementation**
- **In-Memory Storage** (`MemStorage`) for user management
- **localStorage** for persistent performance entries and admin settings
- **sessionStorage** for authentication state

**Database Configuration (Prepared)**
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Neon Database** serverless driver ready for integration
- Migration system configured via `drizzle.config.ts`
- Schema uses Zod for runtime validation

**Data Models**
- **PerformanceEntry**: Content metadata, role assignments, production status.
- **Employee**: Employee details, work schedule, administrative notes.
- **AdminSettings**: Current month, employee recognition messages.
- **User**: Basic user entity (id, username).

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Mechanism**
- Role-based authentication (Admin, Moderator)
- Session-based authentication using `sessionStorage`
- Protected route wrapper for access control

**User Accounts**
1. **Admin Account**: User ID: `MDBD51724`, Password: `shuvo@282##` (Full access)
2. **Moderator Account**: User ID: `DOB`, Password: `dob2.0` (Limited access)

**Authorization Model - Role-Based Access Control**
- **Admin Role**: Full CRUD on all data, access to all reports and settings.
- **Moderator Role**: Can add/edit performance entries, but cannot delete, access sensitive reports, or admin settings.

## External Dependencies

- **YouTube Data API v3**: Via `googleapis` package for video metadata (title, views). Integrated via Replit Connectors for OAuth.
- **Radix UI**: Primitives for accessible UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework.
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting.
- **XLSX (SheetJS)**: Excel export functionality.
- **react-hook-form** with **Zod resolvers**: Form validation.
- **Lucide React**: Icon system.
- **Replit**: Hosting platform, utilizing Replit-specific environment variables and plugins.

## Setup Instructions

### Development Mode
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Access the app at the provided Replit URL

### Production Deployment
1. Click the "Publish" button in Replit
2. The app will build and deploy automatically using the configured autoscale deployment

### YouTube API Setup (Optional)
To enable YouTube video metadata fetching:
1. Use Replit's YouTube connector integration
2. Authenticate with your YouTube account
3. The app will automatically fetch video titles and view counts from YouTube URLs

### Database Migration (Future)
The app currently uses localStorage for data persistence. To migrate to PostgreSQL:
1. Create Drizzle ORM schema in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Run `npm run db:push` to push schema to database
3. Implement API endpoints for database operations
4. Update frontend to use API endpoints instead of localStorage
